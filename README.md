Architectural Images Classification Using Deep Learning
AI Applications in Architecture 
A simple feed-forward deep NN that could predict architects' names based on their designs.
The model could be enhanced by using CNNs or architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet... and of course by building a great dataset of different architects' designs.
